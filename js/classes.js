 Task#1 Point

 Write a class called Point, which represents a point in two-dimensional space.
 A point has x and y properties, given as arguments to its constructor.

 It also has a single method plus, which takes another point and returns the sum of the two points,
 that is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties of the two original points,
 and whose y is the sum of their y properties.

 Task#2 Speaker upgrade

 Rewrite these two object types to use the class keyword, instead of direct prototype manipulation.
 Speaker is a simple type that exposes a speak method which, when called, logs the given text along with the speaker's name.
 Shouter is a subtype of Speaker which shouts its text and makes it uppercase.
